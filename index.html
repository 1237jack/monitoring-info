    <h1>Screen Monitoring Information</h1>
    <p>Dear Students,</p>
    <p>This page is to inform you about the screen monitoring practices in place at our school using Lightspeed Systems.</p>
    <p>Lightspeed Systems captures screenshots of your device at regular intervals. The frequency of these captures may vary based on the settings configured by the school. Typically, it may capture your screen every few seconds to a minute.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to use your devices responsibly and be aware that your online activity may be monitored to ensure a safe and productive learning environment.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to your teacher or the IT department.</p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
